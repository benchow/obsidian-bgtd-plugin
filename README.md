# Obsidian BGTD Plugin

A simple Getting Things Done (GTD) workflow plugin for Obsidian that automatically manages task completion and organization.

## Features

This plugin implements a streamlined GTD workflow with the following features:

### 1. Task Completion Tracking
- Automatically detects when tasks are checked off (changed from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`)
- Logs completed tasks to the console for debugging

### 2. Automatic Task Movement
When a task is completed:
- Removes the completed task from the original file
- Moves it to a corresponding " - Done" file (e.g., `Tasks.md` â†’ `Tasks - Done.md`)
- If the " - Done" file doesn't exist, it creates it automatically
- Places completed tasks at the top of the " - Done" file

### 3. Task Restoration
When a task in a " - Done" file is unchecked:
- Removes the task from the " - Done" file
- Moves it back to the top of the original file
- Converts it back to an active task (`- [ ]`)

## How It Works

The plugin monitors all Markdown files in your vault for changes to task checkboxes. It maintains a cache of file contents to detect when tasks are checked or unchecked.

### Example Workflow

1. **Original file**: `Projects.md`
   ```
   - [ ] Review quarterly reports
   - [ ] Schedule team meeting
   - [ ] Update documentation
   ```

2. **After completing "Review quarterly reports"**:
   - `Projects.md` becomes:
     ```
     - [ ] Schedule team meeting
     - [ ] Update documentation
     ```
   - `Projects - Done.md` is created with:
     ```
     - [x] Review quarterly reports
     ```

3. **If you uncheck the completed task in `Projects - Done.md`**:
   - `Projects - Done.md` becomes empty (or removes the task)
   - `Projects.md` becomes:
     ```
     - [ ] Review quarterly reports
     - [ ] Schedule team meeting
     - [ ] Update documentation
     ```
